This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Update attributes of an object
    Destroy an object
